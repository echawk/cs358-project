## About

This is a student-led project directed under Professor Dan White (Valparaiso University) and his ideal to revolutionize the way in which satellites are scheduled to communicate with ground stations in the SatNOGS database. It is based, in part, off of the existing SatNOGS auto-scheduler, but is also meant to implement a deeper 'bidding'-like system in which satellites and ground-stations can set priorities.

For example, a satellite owner may prefer quantity over quality, meaning they are able to have more poorer connections to their satellite as opposed to having less connections but having them more stable and uninterfered. On the other hand, a ground station owner may want to always have their ground station in use, or may only want to dedicate power and time to projects only if the reliability of the satellite is higher than a specific threshold. 

While this project is not meant to program the algorithms for such specific connection-scheduling needs, it is meant to rather provide a framework in which these plugins can be added.
