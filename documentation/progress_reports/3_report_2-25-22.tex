\maketitle

\section{Objectives Completed}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Continued editing and refining Test Plan based on SatNOGs devs response
	\item Stored and organized retrieved station and satellite data via SatNOGs DB
  \item Scoring Algorithim in basic state (WIP)
  \item Traceability Matrix was created
\end{itemize}

\section{Current Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Implement preferences list into scoring function to modify scoring parameters based on needs
  \item Find out wahte information is most valuable for station ownsers for default pereferences (Send message to Professor White)
  \item Implement pass prediction to be able to score the pass itself as opposed to just the satellite like it is at the current moment.
  \item Schedule meeting with Professor White before spring break
  \item Start implementing auto scheduler code into ours
\end{itemize}
