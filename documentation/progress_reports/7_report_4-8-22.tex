\author{Erik, Ethan, Nick}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Objectives Completed}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Met with Professor White
	\item Reviewed dataset for satellites from 2018 that we will be running our simulator on
	\item Progress made on scheduling algorithm
	\item Progress made on bounty system
	\item Poster Rough Draft
\end{itemize}

\section{Current Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Complete scheduling algorithm
  \item Incorporate sigmoid functions into scoring algorithm
  \item Finish specifications document
\end{itemize}

\section{Meeting with Professor White}
\subsection{Questions}
How to get predicted pass data from a specific station page?

\begin{itemize}
\item Use the dataset that we will get - fair assumption to have
\end{itemize}

Any good visualizations for the poster?

\begin{itemize}
\item See valpo wired lab github page
\end{itemize}

\subsection{General}

Assume satellites are always greedy

Interval tree data structure - allows for easy detection of conflicts particularly when it comes to scheduling - see intervaltree from python

Dont worry about trimming the time the satellite passes
