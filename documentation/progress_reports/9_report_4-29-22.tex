\section{Objectives Completed}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Added unix time conversion function
	\item Kept adding functionality to sigmoid scoring function
  \item Added framework for added priorities (specific to what the station owner wants)
  \item Adjusted scheduling algorithm to add check for pass length being more than 100 seconds long
  \item Attended SOURCE conference and presented poster
  \item Met as a group to discuss final deliverables
  \item Organized what we need to do before final due date
\end{itemize}

\section{Current Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Fix bug that is causing the same satellite to schedule over new satellites
  \item Organize all work done into a folder and submit
  \item Finish sigmoid function implementation
  \item Finish Tracability matrix to showcase final verdict on what is finished and what would need implementation in future work
\end{itemize}
