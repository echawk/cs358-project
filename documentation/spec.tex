\section{General Information}

SatNOGS is an open-source project which contains a database consisting of many
satellites and observers, allowing ground station owners to manually schedule
communications between it and overhead satellites, enabling the satellite owner
to acquire data from the satellite. As it stands, the SatNOGS schedule relies
entirely on observers manually scheduling satellites that are predicted to pass
over the ground station. The project was tasked with providing the framework
towards a more automated solution for the SatNOGS community, working alongside
both the team at Valparaiso University and the SatNOGS developers. The proposed
solution is a framework that will allow the individual owners of the satellites
and the ground stations to make compromises allowing greater flexibility in the
priorities of scheduling a job. This turns the current scheduling system into a
more versatile and automated auction-style system defined by the user that
removes the need for end-users to manually schedule individual overhead
satellite communications.

\subsection{Quality Objectives}

To evaluate quality, the documentation should provide any future implementers
and SatNOGS community members enough information, as well as coherent enough
information to pick up where we left off. Particularly with regards to the
implementation of this software system.
